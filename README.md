# CHORES List

This is the first challenge task: create a TODO list using the basics
principles from **React** and **TypeScript**.

In the CHORES List, you can create new chores, delete new chores, and
tag them when they are done. You can see a text telling you how many
chores you have on the list and how many were completed.
